# Actively_Shimmed_Metal_Needles_For_MRI

This repository holds the modeling code for design of actively shimmied metallic needles and probrs for use in MRI. Needle_FieldSimulation.m models the metallic needle field, designs a shim coil and calculates the shim produced fields. 
VolShim_2coil.m performs shimming in the magnet frame to compute the required currents in  two shim coils.
